All of it is on OSF. I can't upload huge amounts of data to github, but this folder has almost everything.
What it's missing are individual subject folders and generated importance maps for the most part. Those I have compressed and uploaded to OSF.

I have uploaded a picture to show what this folder should look like with those folders downloaded and reintegrated.
